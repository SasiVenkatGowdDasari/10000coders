        <h1>Sharekhan</h1>
        <p>I am <span>Sharekhan</span>, a Muslim general and emperor from the 17th century. I played a pivotal, albeit brief, role in
            a certain tale. I witnessed the intense battle and tragic love story of the warrior Kaala Bhairava and
            Princess Mitravinda. Impressed by Bhairava's valor and devotion, I predicted that the warrior would be
            reborn to reunite with his lost love. In the present day, my reincarnation is Solomon, a benevolent
            fisherman who helps the reborn Harsha rescue Indu and fulfill their past-life destiny.</p>
